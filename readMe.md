# Result looks like this :
# accuracy of identification the correct authors: must be more than 60%, but less than 90% , 
# my goal was to show that the SVM algorithm is intelligent , 
# but not the most accurate algo for anticipating the right authors.
# the goal of the project is to show that the RNN (deep learning) algo is stronger than the SVM (machine Learning) algo.
# so the SVM algo gave us success by accuracy of 67% , but the RNN gave us accuracy higher than 90%.
# sp=o by programming this project we have achieved the goal of the theoretical article 
# which is  between the Machine Learning algorithms VS the deepLearning algorithms(which are more sophisticated ).
